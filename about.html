		<p>Lupe Cunha originates from Brazil from where her colours are inspired.</p>

		<p>She started her artistic life as a photographer over 40 years ago first in Chicago where
		 she was inspired by the Abstract Expressionists and the frozen waters of Lake Michigan 
		 back in the 70's, then in Brazil where she was inspired by the colour work of Helio 
		 Oiticica and the mountains and sea of Rio and then finally settling in the UK where 
		 artists like John Piper and Patrick Heron continued to inspire her work while cooling 
		 her colours down with our milder weather.</p>
		<p>Her work continues to be an abstract figurative style usually inspired on her own travels
		 and photographs and memories from which she composes her paintings. One of her recent 
		 projects relates to her personal history and relates to her childhood and her family home.</p>
		<p>Also more recently she has started sourcing her abstracts from lyrics and poetry. This excursion
		 into painting from poetry has been a welcome addition to her inspiration sources and something
		  she looks to continuing to explore in her work.</p>
		<p>But inveriably she returns to painting from the sea and or the mountains, both dominant 
		influences from her early life and very important to her creative life.</p>
		<p>Lupe Cunha lives in Sudbury and works from Cuckoo Farm Studios in Colchester.</p>
		She runs regular monthly <a href='events.php?mode=workshops'>workshops</a>
		in Benham Gallery at CFS and in the grounds of the farm 
		over the summer. You can see her current programme in Other Events. </p>
